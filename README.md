There was a lot of inspiration for this project and getting it done. I would
like to thank:

- @brikis98 for helping me come up with the idea
- [Promises, understanding by doing](http://modernjavascript.blogspot.com/2013/08/promisesa-understanding-by-doing.html) for the initial promise spec
- cujos/when for fully featured examples
- aheckmann/mpromise for node.js specific implementation
- promises-aplus/promises-tests for the test suite
